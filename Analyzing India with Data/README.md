# AirSewa Analysis Report

## Overview
This project analyzes data from the **AirSewa** portal to evaluate the performance of various Indian airports based on passenger feedback and service quality metrics. The goal is to identify patterns in customer complaints, service quality issues, and operational inefficiencies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on:
- Passenger complaints and grievances
- Response times and resolutions
- Airport service quality metrics
- Types of complaints (delays, baggage issues, staff behavior, etc.)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and correlations.
3. **Visualization**: Graphical representation of key findings.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding passenger sentiment towards services.
5. **Performance Benchmarking**: Comparing airports based on complaint resolution efficiency.

## Key Findings
- **Top Issues**: Frequent complaints about baggage handling, delays, and customer service.
- **Response Times**: Significant variation in complaint resolution times across airports.
- **Service Ratings**: Some airports consistently receive lower ratings, indicating systemic service issues.
