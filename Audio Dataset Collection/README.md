# Public Radio Audio Dataset

## Dataset Name: Radio_Audio_Collection

### Description
The **Radio_Audio_Collection** dataset consists of recorded audio clips from various online public radio stations. The dataset is designed for analyzing spoken word content, music, and other audio characteristics in radio streams.

### Use Case
This dataset can be used for:
- **Speech Recognition & NLP:** Extracting spoken content for transcription and analysis.
- **Music Genre Classification:** Identifying and categorizing music played on different stations.
- **Sentiment & Topic Analysis:** Analyzing conversations and debates on talk radio.
- **Multimodal Learning:** Combining audio analysis with other forms of media for AI research.

### Data Collection Process
The dataset is generated by capturing audio streams from online radio stations. The script automates the process by:
1. Connecting to the live stream.
2. Recording audio for a specified duration.
3. Saving the recordings as MP3 files.
4. Logging metadata such as station name, timestamp, and clip duration.

### Streaming Sources
Below are some radio streams used for data collection:

```python
stream_sources = {
    "Radio Paradise": "http://stream.radioparadise.com/aac-320",
    "Mixcloud": "https://www.mixcloud.com/",
    "KRSC-FM": "http://www.rsukrscfm.rsu.edu:8000/rsuradio128k",
}
```
