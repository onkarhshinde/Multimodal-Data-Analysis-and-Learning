Chile, your sky is a pure blue,Pure breezes blow across you,And your field, embroidered with flowers,Is a happy copy of Eden.Majestic is the snow-covered mountainThat was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,That was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,And the sea that tranquilly washes your shorePromises future splendour for you,And the sea that tranquilly washes your shorePromises future splendour for you.CHORUS:Sweet fatherland, accept the vowsWith which Chile swore at your altars:Either you’ll be the tomb of the freeOr the refuge against oppressionEither you’ll be the tomb of the freeOr the refuge against oppressionEither you’ll be the tomb of the freeOr the refuge against oppressionOr the refuge against oppressionOr the refuge against oppression.
