1.Fair Antigua and Barbuda!We thy sons and daughters standStrong and firm in peace or dangerTo safe-guard our Native LandWe commit ourselves to buildingA true nation brave and free;Ever striving, ever seeking,Dwell in love and unity2.Raise the standard! Raise it boldly!Answer now to duty’s callTo the service of thy country,Sparing nothing, giving all;Gird your loins and join the battle‘Gainst fear, hate and poverty,Each endeavouring, all achieving,Live in peace where man is free.3.God of nations, let Thy blessingsFall upon this land of ours;Rain and sunshine ever sending,Fill her fields with crops and flowers;We her children do implore Thee,Give us strength, faith, loyalty,Never failing, all enduringTo defend her liberty.
