CHORUS:Children of Benin, arise!The resounding cry of freedomIs heard at the first light of dawn;Children of Benin, arise!1.Formerly, at her call, our ancestorsKnew how to engage in mighty battlesWith strength, courage, ardour, and full of joy, but at the price of blood.Builders of the present, you too, join forcesEach day for the task stronger in unity.Build without ceasing for posterity.Chorus2.When all around there blows a wind of anger and hate:Citizen of Benin, be proud, and in a calm spiritTrusting in the future, behold your flag!In the green you read hope of spring;The red signifies the courage of your ancestors;The yellow foretells the richest treasures.Chorus3.Beloved Benin, your sunny mountains, palm trees, and green pasturesShow everywhere your brightness;Your soil offers everyone the richest fruits.Benin, from henceforth your sons are unitedWith one brotherly spirit sharing the hope of seeing youEnjoy abundance and happiness for ever.Chorus
