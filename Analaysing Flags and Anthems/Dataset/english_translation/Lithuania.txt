Lithuania, our homeland,Land of worshiped heroes!Let your sons draw their strengthFrom our past experience.Let your children always followOnly roads of virtue,May your own, mankindâ€™s well-beingBe the goals they work for.May the sun above our landBannish darkening clouds aroundLight and truth all alongGuide our steps forever.May the love of LithuaniaBrightly burn in our hearts.For the sake this landLet unity blossom.
