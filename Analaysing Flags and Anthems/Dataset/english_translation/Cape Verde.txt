Sing, brotherSing, my brotherFor Freedom is a hymnAnd Man a certainty.With dignity, bury the seedIn the dust of the naked island:In life Ã­s precipiceHope is as big as the seaWhich embraces us.Unwavering sentinel of the seas and windsBetween the stars and the Atlantic oceanSing the Chant of Freedom.Sing, brotherSing, my brotherFor Freedom is a hymnAnd Man a certainty.
