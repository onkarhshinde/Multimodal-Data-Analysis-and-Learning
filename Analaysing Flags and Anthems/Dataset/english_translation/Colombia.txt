CHORUS:O unfading glory!O immortal joy!In furrows of paingoodness germinates nowgoodness germinates now.O unfading glory!O immortal joy!In furrows of paingoodness germinates now.1.The horrible night has ceased,the sublime libertyspills the aurorasof its invincible light.All humanity,moans within its chains,understands the wordsof He who died on the Cross.Chorus2.“Independence!” criesthe American world;soaked in blood of heroesthe land of Columbus.Still, one great principle,“The king is not sovereign”,resounds, and those who sufferbless their passion.Chorus3.The Orinoco’s bedfills with the remains,of blood and tears a riveris there seen flowing.In Bárbula they don’t knowthe souls nor the eyes,if admiration or horrorfeel or suffer.Chorus4.On the shores of the Caribbean,famished, the people fight,horrors preferringto treacherous health.O, aye! for Cartagenathe abnegation is much,and the shambles of deathits courage despises.Chorus5.From Boyacá in the fields,the genius of glory,for every ear a heroundefeated crowned.Soldiers without breastplatewon victory;their virile breathas shield served.Chorus6.Bolivar crosses the Andesthat two oceans bathe,swords as sparksshine in Junín.Untameable centaursdescend to the plains,and a prescience begins to be felt,of the epic the end.Chorus7.The victorious trumpetin Ayacucho thunders,that in every triumph growsits formidable sound.In its expansive thrustLiberty is worn for the first time,from the American skya pavilion forming.Chorus8.The virgin her hairspulls out in agonyand from her beloved widowedhangs them on a cypress.Regretting her hopecovered by a cold headstone,but glorious pridehallows her fair skin.Chorus9.Thus the motherland is formed,Thermopylaes are breaking forth;constellation of cyclopsits night brightened.The trembling flowerfinding the wind mortal,underneath the laurelssafety sought.Chorus10.But it’s not complete gloryto defeat in battle,that the arm that fightsis encouraged by truth.Independence aloneThe great clamour doesn’t silence;if the sun illuminates everyone,justice is liberty.Chorus11.From men the rightsNariño’s preaching,the soul of struggleprophetically taught.Ricaurte in San Mateo,in atoms flying,“Duty before life,”with flames he wrote.Chorus
