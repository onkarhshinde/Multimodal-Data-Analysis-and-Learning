1.The land of thousand islands and skerries,Born from deep beneath the wavesÅland, our Åland, our home it isThee we long to meetAncient graves beneath the birchesTells of our thousand year historyWe will never forget the land of our FathersNo matter where we will goNo matter where we will go2.Lovely is our Åland when bays and straitsBecome blue in the bright days of springIt’s delightful to wander in forest and groveIn the flowered fields of our shores.Midsummer pole to evening red skyIs raised by willing handsFarthest out in the skerry fisher villageBeacons are lit by the youngBeacons are lit by the young3.Lovely is our Åland when the froth of wavesis whirling against the mighty precipiceWhen the church folks steer beneath the starsOver the icy depths of the seaEven when storm roars, in the cottages’ peaceThe song of the spinning wheel is sungThe memory of loving childhood isHappily praised by the sonsHappily praised by the sons4.Never have Alandian women and menLet the honour of their tribe downWarfare threatened us, but victoriously yetWe carry the heritage of freedomLoudly shall it sound, our Swedish languageSpoken with an urging voiceEnlighten our path like a sea mark of flamesShow us where we belongShow us where we belong
