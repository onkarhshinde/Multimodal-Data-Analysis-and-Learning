1.â€˜Tis here we are pledging,with heart and with hand,Full measure of devotionto thee, our native land,Full measure of devotionto thee, our native land.2.Now all join the chorus,let union abide.Across all Micronesiajoin hands on every side,Across all Micronesiajoin hands on every side.3.We all work together,with hearts, voice and hand,Till we have made these islandsanother promised land,Till we have made these islandsanother promised land.
