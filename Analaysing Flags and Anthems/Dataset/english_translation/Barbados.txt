1.In plenty and in time of needWhen this fair land was youngOur brave forefathers sowed the seedFrom which our pride is sprung,A pride that makes no wanton boastOf what it has withstoodThat binds our hearts from coast to coast –The pride of nationhood.CHORUS:We loyal sons and daughters allDo hereby make it knownThese fields and hills beyond recallAre now our very own.We write our names on history’s pageWith expectations great,Strict guardians of our heritage,Firm craftsmen of our fate.2.The Lord has been the people’s guideFor past three hundred years.With him still on the people’s sideWe have no doubts or fears.Upward and onward we shall go,Inspired, exulting, free,And greater will our nation growIn strength and unity.Chorus
