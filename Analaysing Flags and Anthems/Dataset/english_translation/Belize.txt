1.O, land of the free by the Carib Sea,our manhood we pledge to thy liberty!No tyrants here linger, despots must fleeThis tranquil haven of democracyThe blood of our sires which hallows the sod,Brought freedom from slavery oppression’s rod,By the might of truth and the grace of God.No longer shall we be hewers of wood.CHORUS:Arise! ye sons of the Baymen’s clan,put on your armour, clear the land!Drive back the tyrants, let despots flee-Land of the Free by the Carib Sea!2.Nature has blessed thee with wealth untold,O’er mountains and valleys where praries roll;Our fathers, the Baymen, valiant and boldDrove back the invader; this heritage holdFrom proud Rio Hondo to old Sarstoon’Through coral isle, over blue lagoon;Keep watch with the angels, the stars and moon;For freedom comes tomorrow’s noon.Chorus
