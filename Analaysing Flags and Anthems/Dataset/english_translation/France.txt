1.Arise children of the fatherlandThe day of glory has arrivedAgainst us tyranny’sBloody standard is raisedThe bloody standard is raisedListen to the sound in the fieldsThe howling of these fearsome soldiersThey are coming into our midstTo cut the throats of your sons and consortsCHORUS:To arms citizensForm you battalionsMarch, marchLet impure bloodWater our furrows2.What do they want this horde of slavesOf traitors and conspiratorial kings?For whom these vile chainsThese long-prepared irons?These long-prepared irons?Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrageWhat methods must be taken?It is we they dare planTo return to the old slavery!Chorus3.What! These foreign cohorts!They would make laws in our courts!What! These mercenary phalanxesWould cut down our warrior sonsCut down our warrior sonsGood Lord! By chained handsOur brow would yield under the yokeThe vile despots would have themselves beThe masters of destinyChorus4.Tremble, tyrants and traitorsThe shame of all good menTremble! Your parricidal schemesWill receive their just rewardWill receive their just rewardAgainst you we are all soldiersIf they fall, our young herosFrance will bear new onesReady to join the fight against youChorus5.Frenchmen, as magnanimous warriorsBear or hold back your blowsSpare these sad victimsWho with regret are taking up arms against usWith regret are taking up arms against usBut not these bloody despotsThese accomplices of BouilléAll these tigers who pitilesslyAre ripping open their mothers’ breastsChorus6.Sacred Love for the FatherlandLead and support our avenging armsLiberty, cherished libertyJoin the struggle with your defendersJoin the struggle with your defendersUnder our flags, let victoryHasten to you virile forceSo that in death your enemiesSee your triumph and our glory!Chorus7.We shall enter into the pitWhen our elders will no longer be thereThere we shall find their ashesAnd the mark of their virtuesAnd the mark of their virtuesWe are much less jealous of surviving themThan of sharing their coffinsWe shall have the sublime prideOf avenging or joining themChorus
