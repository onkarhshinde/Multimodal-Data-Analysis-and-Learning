1.Isle forgotten by the gods, unknown by the men,You were sleeping, languid, waiting for a given name,When the drum of the feet trampling your blond coves,Tore you out of your dream and opened you to the world.CHORUS:Ouanalaoor Saint BarthélemyIsle of the Antilles and isle of FranceDon’t give up your faith, don’t give up your hopeYour freedom remains our motto2.Arawaks, Caraibes, Bretons and piratesEnglish, Flemish, French, Spanish and settlersCanoes, caravelles, galiotes and galions.Have written your history at the bottom of your bays.Chorus3.Your children, seamen they were, went from isle to isleTo catch elsewhere the fortune you didn’t give to themBut from the kings’ words, Swedish and then FrenchThey received as inheritance honor and dignity.Chorus4.Land of hope, of fire, of pain and of spiritDefying the ocean, the winds, the hurricanesWithout complaint your daughters and sons they rebuildAs their parents have always done before them.Chorus5.To your barren hills give your beautiful beachesTo your years of drought, your hours of plentyTo your exiled sons their strength and their powerTo your moments of doubts the word of the wise men.Chorus
