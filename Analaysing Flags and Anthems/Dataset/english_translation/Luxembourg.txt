1.Where the Alzette flows through the meadows,The Sura breaks through the crags.Where the vine fragrant grows along the Moselle,The sky promises us wine:There lies the land for which we willinglyDare everything down here.Our homeland which we so deeplyCarry in our hearts.Our homeland which we so deeplyCarry in our hearts.2.O Thou above, Whose powerful handLeads the nations through the world,Protect the Luxembourg landFrom foreign yoke and threat.As children Thou already instilled in us allThe spirit of freedom.Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,Shine for evermore.Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,Shine for evermore.
