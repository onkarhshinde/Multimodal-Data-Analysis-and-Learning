1.O Lord, bless the nation of HungaryWith your grace and bountyExtend toward it your guarding armDuring strife with its enemiesLong torn by ill fateBring upon it a time of reliefThis nation has suffered for all sinsOf the past and of the future!2.You brought our ancestors upOver the Carpathians’ holy peaksBy You was won a beautiful homelandFor Bendegúz’s sonsAnd wherever flow the rivers ofThe Tisza and the DunaÁrpád our hero’s descendantsWill root and bloom.3.For us on the plains of the KunsYou ripened the wheatIn the grape fields of TokajYou dripped sweet nectarOur flag you often plantedOn the wild Turk’s earthworksAnd under Mátyás’ grave army whimperedVienna’s “proud fort.”4.Hajh, but for our sinsAnger gathered in Your bosomAnd You struck with Your lightningFrom Your thundering cloudsNow the plundering Mongols’ arrowsYou swarmed over usThen the Turks’ slave yokeWe took upon our shoulders.5.How often came from the mouthsOf Osman’s barbarian nationOver the corpses of our defeated armyA victory song!How often did your own son agressMy homeland, upon your breast,And you became because of your own sonsYour own sons’ funeral urn!6.The fugitive hid, and towards himThe sword reached into his caveLooking everywhere he could not findHis home in his homelandClimbs the mountain, descends the valleySadness and despair his companionsSea of blood beneath his feetOcean of flame above.7.Castle stood, now a heap of stonesHappiness and joy fluttered,Groans of death, weepingNow sound in their place.And Ah! Freedom does not bloomFrom the blood of the dead,Torturous slavery’s tears fallFrom the cold eyes of the orphans!8.Redeem, O Lord, the HungariansWho are tossed by waves of dangerExtend toward it your guarding armOn the sea of its miseryLong torn by ill fateBring upon it a time of reliefThey who have suffered for all sinsOf the past and of the future!
