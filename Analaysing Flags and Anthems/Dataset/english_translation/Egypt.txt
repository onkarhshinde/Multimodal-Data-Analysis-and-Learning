CHORUS:My homeland, my homeland, my homeland,My love and my heart are for thee.My homeland, my homeland, my homeland,My love and my heart are for thee.1.Egypt! O mother of all lands,My hope and my ambition,How can one countThe blessings of the Nile for mankind?Chorus2.Egypt! Most precious jewel,Shining on the brow of eternity!O my homeland, be for ever free,Safe from every foe!Chorus3.Egypt! Noble are thy children,Loyal, and guardians of thy soil.In war and peaceWe give our lives for thy sake.Chorus
