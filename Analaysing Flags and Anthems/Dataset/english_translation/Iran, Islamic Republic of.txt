Upwards on the horizon rises the Eastern Sun,The light in the eyes of those who believe inthe right.Bahman â€“ the brilliance of our Faith.Your message, O Imam, of independence and freedomis imprinted on our souls.O Martyrs! Your cries echo in the ears of history.Enduring, continuing, eternal,The Islamic Republic of Iran.
