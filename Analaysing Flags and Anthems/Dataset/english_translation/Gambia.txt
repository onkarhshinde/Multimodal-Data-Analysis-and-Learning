For The Gambia, our homelandWe strive and work and pray,That all may live in unity,Freedom and peace each day.Let justice guide our actionsTowards the common good,And join our diverse peoplesTo prove manâ€™s brotherhood.We pledge our firm allegiance,Our promise we renew;Keep us, great God of nations,To The Gambia ever true.
