1.O Land of Beauty!Our country where peace abounds,Thy children stand freeOn the strength of will and love.With God in all our struggles,Saint Kitts and Nevis beA Nation bound togetherWith a common destiny.2.As stalwarts we stand,For justice and liberty,With wisdom and truthWe will serve and honour thee.No sword nor spear can conquer,For God will sure defend.His blessings shall for everTo posterity extend.
