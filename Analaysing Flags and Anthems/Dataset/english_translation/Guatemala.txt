1.Fortunate Guatemala! May your altarsNever be profaned by cruel men.May there never be slaves who submit to their yoke,Or tyrants who deride you.If tomorrow your sacred soilShould be threatened by foreign invasion,Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,Will call to you: Conquer or die.CHORUS:Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,Will call to you: Conquer or die;For your people, with heart and soul,Would prefer death to slavery.2.From your old and hard chainsYou forged, with an ire-driven hand,The plow that fertilizes the soilAnd the sword that saves honor.Our fathers fought one day,Lit up in patriotic burningAnd they were able, without bloody clash,To place you on a throne of love.CHORUS:And they were able, without bloody clash,To place you on a throne of love,That our Nation, in energetic assent,Gave life to the ideal redeemer.3.Your emblem shows a piece of the skyIn which a cloud gets its whitenessWretched is he who dares in madnessstain your colorsWell, your brave and proud sonswho admire the peace withinwill never avoid the rough battlesif they are to defend their land and their home.CHORUS:They will never avoid the rough battlesif they are to defend their land and their homethat honor is the idea that reigns their soulsand the altar of the mother country their altar4.Lying in the magnificent Andeswith two oceans at hearing distanceunder the wing of seeds and goldyou become entranced from the beautiful quetzalNative bird that lives in your sealprotector that protects your soilhopefully he will fly highmore than the condor and the royal eagle!CHORUS:Hopefully he will fly highmore than the condor and the royal eagleand in his wings, raise up to the sky:Guatemala, your immortal name!
