1.Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand yearsRapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years.Against the cynical malice in the shapeOf neo-colonialism and its petty local servants.Many gave in and certain others resisted.But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the bloodHave fortified our courageous people and fertilized its heroic struggle.CHORUS:And one single night has drawn togetherThe history of an entire people,And one single night has launched its triumphal march.Towards the horizon of good fortune.One single night has brought together our peopleWith all the peoples of the World,In the acquisition of liberty and progress.Motherland or death, we shall conquer.2.Nourished in the lively source of the Revolution,The volunteers for liberty and peaceWith their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the 4 of AugustHad not only hand arms, but also and above allThe flame in their hearts lawfully to freeFaso forever from the fetters of those whoHere and there were polluting the sacred soul of independence and sovereignty.Chorus3.And seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity,Love and honour partnered with humanity,The people of Burkina sing a victory hymnTo the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation.Down with exploitation of man by man!Forward for the good of every manBy all men of today and tomorrow, by every man here and always!Chorus4.Popular revolution our nourishing sap.Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man.Eternal hearth of agreed democracy,Where at last national identity has the right of freedom.Where injustice has lost its place forever,And where from the hands of builders of a glorious worldEverywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen and suns of boundless joy shine.Chorus
