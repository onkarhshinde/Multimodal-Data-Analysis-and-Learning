1.O land of soft, fresh breezesAnd verdant trees so fair,With the Creator’s gloryReflected ev’rywhere,O sea of palest em’rald,Merging to darkest blue,Whene’er my thoughts fly Godward,I always think of you.CHORUS:Dear, verdant island, set in blue Caribbean Sea,I’m coming, coming very soon, O beautious isle, to thee.Although I wandered far,My heart enshrines thee yet.Homeland, fair Cayman Isle,I cannot thee forget.2.Away from noise of cities,Their fret and carking care,With moonbeams’ soft caresses,Unchecked by garish glare,Thy fruit with rarest juices,Abundant, rich and free,When sweet church bells are chiming,My fond heart yearns for thee.Chorus3.When tired of all excitementAnd glam’rous worldly care,How sweet thy shores to reachAnd find a welcome there,And when comes on the seasonOf peace, goodwill to man,‘Tis then I love thee best of all,Beloved Isle, Cayman.Chorus
