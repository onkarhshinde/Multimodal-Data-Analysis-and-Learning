CHORUS:O homeland, we greet you a thousand times!Glory be to you, O homeland, glory be to you!Your breast overflows with joy and peace,And we see your radiant face shiningMore brightly than the sun.2.The worthy sons of the soilWhich Pichincha on high is adorning,Always acclaimed you as sovereign ladyAnd shed their blood for you.God observed and accepted the sacrifice,And that blood was the prolific seedOf other heroes whom the world in astonishment sawArising in thousands around you.Chorus3.For these steel armed heroesNothing in the land was invincibleAnd from the valley to the high SierraCould the clamour of the struggle be heard;After the struggle, victory came flying.And freedom followed on victoryâ€™s heel.And the toppled lion could be heard,As it roared in impotence and vanity.Chorus
