1.O land of our birth,O gem of God’s earth,O Island so strong and so fair;Built firm as Barrool,Thy Throne of Home RuleMakes us free as thy sweet mountain air.2.When Orry, the Dane,In Mannin did reign,‘Twas said he had come from above;For wisdom from Heav’nTo him had been giv’nTo rule us with justice and love.3.Our fathers have toldHow Saints came of old,Proclaiming the Gospel of Peace;That sinful desires,Like false Baal fires,Must die ere our troubles can cease.4.Ye sons of the soil,In hardship and toil,That plough both the land and the sea,Take heart while you canAnd think of the ManWho toiled by the Lake Galilee.5.When fierce tempests smoteThat frail little boat,They ceased at His gentle command;Despite all our fear,The Saviour In nearTo safeguard our dear Fatherland.6.Let storm-winds rejoice,And lift up their voice,No danger our homes can befall;Our green hills and rocksEncircle our flocks,And keep out the sea like a wall.7.Our Island, thus blest,No foe can molest;Our grain and our fish stall increase;From battle and swordProtecteth the Lord,And crowneth our nation with peace.8.Then let us rejoiceWith heart, soul, and voice,And in the Lord’s promise confide;That each single hourWe trust in His powerNo evil our souls can betide.
