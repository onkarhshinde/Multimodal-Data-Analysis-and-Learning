1.Valients of Quisqueya,Let us sing with strong feelingAnd let us show to the worldOur invincible, glorious banner.Hail, O people who, strong and intrepid,Launched into war and went to death!Under a warlike menace of death,You broke your chains of slavery.2.No country deserves to be freeIf it is an indolent and servile slave,If the call does not grow loud within it,Tempered by a virile heroism.But the brave and indomitable QuisqueyaWill always hold its head high,For if it were a thousand times enslaved,It would a thousand times regain liberty.3.If it will be exposed to ruse and deceitUnto contempt of a real imposer,On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were placesWhere the traces of glory are found.Where on the top of the heroic bastion,The word of the libarated became flesh,Where the genius of Sánchez and DuarteTaught to be free or to die.4.And if an unattended leader the splendorOf these glorious events could ignore,One has seen in Capotillo in the warThe flag of fire wave.And the fire that lets the proud lionOf Castilla become stupefied,Removes him from the glorious beachesWhere the crossed banner waves.5.Compatriots, let us proudlyShow our face, from today prouder than ever;Quisqueya may be destroyedBut a slave again, never!It is a sanctuary of love that every characterOf the fatherland feels alive!And it is his coat of arms, the right;And it is his device: be free or die.6.Liberty that still rises cool-bloodedlyThe victory in her triumphal car.And the clarion of war re-echoesProclaiming his immortal glory.Liberty! That the echo’s touchWhile they’re full of noble tensionOur fields of glory repeatLiberty! Liberty! Liberty!
