1.Sky of golden sun,Steppe of golden seed,Legend of courage –Take a look at my country!From antiquityOur heroic glory emerged,They did not give up their prideMy Kazakh people are strong!CHORUS:My country, my country,As your flower I will be planted,As your song I will stream, my country!My native land  – My Kazakhstan!2.The way was opened to posterityI have a vast land.Its unity is proper,I have an independent country.It welcomed the timeLike an eternal friend,Our country is happy,Such is our country.Chorus
