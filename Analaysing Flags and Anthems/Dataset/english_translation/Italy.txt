1.Italian Brothers,Italy has awakened,She has wreathed her headWith the helmet of Scipio.Where is Victory?She bows her head to you,You, whom God createdAs theslave of Rome.Italian Brothers,Italy has awakened,She has wreathed her headWith the helmet of Scipio.Where is Victory?She bows her head to you,You, whom God createdAs the slave of Rome.CHORUS:Let us band together,We are ready to die,We are ready to die,Italy has called us.Let us band together,We are ready to die,We are ready to die,Italy has called us! (Yes!)2.We were for centuriesDowntrodden and derided,because we are not one people,because we are divided.Let one flag, one hopegather us all.The hour has struckfor us to join together.3.Let us unite and love one another,Union and loveShow the peopleThe way of the Lord.Let us swear to freeOur native soil;United under God,Who can defeat us?Chorus4.From the Alps  to Sicily,Legnano is everywhere;Every man has the heartand hand of FerruccioThe children of ItalyAre all called Balilla;Every trumpet blastsounds the Vespers.5.Mercenary swords,theyâ€™re feeble reeds.The Austrian eagleHas already lost its plumes.The blood of Italyand the Polish bloodIt drank, along with the Cossack,But it burned its heart.Chorus
