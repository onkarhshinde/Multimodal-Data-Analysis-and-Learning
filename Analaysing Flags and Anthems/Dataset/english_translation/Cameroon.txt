1.O Cameroon cradle of our ancestors,Go, stand and jealous of your freedom.As the sun, your flag should also be proud,A symbol of ardent faith and unity,May all your children, North and SouthFrom East to West, are all love!May they serve you as their sole purposeTo fulfill their duty forever.CHORUS:Dear Fatherland, dear land,You are our only true happiness.Our joy, our lifeTo you, love and honor.2.Thou art the grave where our fathers sleep,The garden that our ancestors have cultivated.We work to make you prosperousOne day we finally arrived.Africaâ€™s children be faithfulAnd still progressing in peaceHoping that your childrenBoundless love you forever.Chorus
