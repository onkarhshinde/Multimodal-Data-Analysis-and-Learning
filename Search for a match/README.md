# Audio-Video Matching & Collision Detection

This project processes **audio and video files** to:
- Extract duration information.
- Detect **high-frequency peaks** in audio, which may indicate **collision events**.
- Use **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** and the **Hungarian Algorithm** for matching audio and video sequences.

---

##  Features

1. **Audio & Video Duration Analysis**
   - Extracts durations from `.wav` (audio) and `.mp4` (video) files.
   - Uses `librosa` for **audio processing** and `cv2` for **video processing**.
   - Counts occurrences of different durations.

2. **Collision Detection in Audio**
   - Computes **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**.
   - Normalizes energy levels and detects peaks using `find_peaks`.
   - Visualizes detected **collision peaks** in audio.

3. **Audio-Video Matching**
   - Uses **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** to find similarities between **audio** and **video** events.
   - Uses the **Hungarian Algorithm** to determine the optimal matching between detected peaks.
